I went to the bathroom walking unsteadily, as i tried to focus i feel nauseous. I try to vomit but it wont come out.. After taking panadol and sleep for few hours, i still feel the same.. By the way, if i lay down or sit down, my head do not spin, only when i want to move around then i feel the whole world is spinning.. And it is normal stomach discomfort at the same time? Earlier after i relieved myself, the spinning lessen so i am not sure whether its connected or coincidences.. Thank you doc!\n",
              "output         Hi, Thank you for posting your query. The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. \n",

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.   \n",
              "2       Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,  \n",

If you self-medicated for inducing the abortion, you should see a specialist for further help. You also need a sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route to clarify. Any retained products would have caused persistent bleeding/infection and so on. Ineffective abortion can lead to continuation of the pregnancy, but, since you had heavy bleeding after medication, this is unlikely. Pregnancy test remains positive for sometime after the abortion since the hormone levels take time to decline. The test can be repeated now. Hope this helps.  \n",

Treatment of pleurisy is depending on cause. There are many causes for pleurisy. But the most common ones are1. Pneumonia. 2. Tb3. Pleural effusion.4. Pulmonary contusions. So better to get done chest x-ray and start treatment accordingly. If chest x-ray is normal than possibility of muscular pain is more. Try to follow these for muscular pain.1. Avoid heavy weight lifting.2. Avoid strenuous exercise. 3. Take good painkillers and muscle relaxant. 4. Avoid bad postures in sleep.5. Apply warm water pad to the affected site  \n",
              "112164       Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. The condition your husband is having is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-responding cases there are many other Chat Doctor.  Hope this will help you in resolving your query. Thank you   \n",

              "      <td>I was diagnosis with pleurisy last Tuesday, and am still having sharp pains in my right side of my chest, rib cage and right shoulder blade and lower half of my back. I have already had an EKG and I am having a chest xray today. How long can these symptoms last can could it be something more serious?</td>\n",
              "      <td>Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Treatment of pleurisy is depending on cause. There are many causes for pleurisy. But the most common ones are1. Pneumonia. 2. Tb3. Pleural effusion.4. Pulmonary contusions. So better to get done chest x-ray and start treatment accordingly. If chest x-ray is normal than possibility of muscular pain is more. Try to follow these for muscular pain.1. Avoid heavy weight lifting.2. Avoid strenuous exercise. 3. Take good painkillers and muscle relaxant. 4. Avoid bad postures in sleep.5. Apply warm water pad to the affected site</td>\n",

He has been taking antibiotics (Levaquin, sorry about the spelling) and just finished the last one today. Was in the hospital last week for 2 days with bronchitis / pneumonia. Has also been taking Mucinex. He has gone to bed in the last few minutes and is sleeping peacefully. I was very nervous about the rash and wondered what I should do, as there seem to be no other symptoms.Thank you.Brenda Wooten YYYY@YYYY</td>\n",
              "      <td>Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. The condition your husband is having is called Urticaria or hives. It's an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up. You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IGE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various antihistamines for long duration(at least 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non-responding cases there are many other Chat Doctor.  Hope this will help you in resolving your query. Thank you</td>\n",
